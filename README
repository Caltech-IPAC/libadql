Libadql is a C++ library for parsing expressions in the IVOA
Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL).

  http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/2.0

Libadql uses boost::spirit and requires C++11 support.  To build, use
the included version of waf.

  ./waf configure
  ./waf
  ./waf install

libadql only supports a subset of ADQL.  Specifically, it requires the
geometric and non-geometric parts of the WHERE clause to be separate.
